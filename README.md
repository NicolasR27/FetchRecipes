## App Overview

### Summary  
This app is a recipe discovery tool built with SwiftUI and a custom coordinator-based navigation system. It allows users to browse a list of recipes, view detailed instructions, and navigate smoothly between views.  
Screenshots or a short video walkthrough should be included here to highlight the core user flow and features.

## Focus Areas

I focused heavily on building a scalable navigation structure using the Coordinator Pattern. This approach keeps navigation logic separate from the views, which makes the app easier to maintain and expand. I also prioritized keeping the UI clean and responsive using SwiftUI's latest features like `NavigationStack` with path-based routing.

## Time Spent

I spent approximately 1 hour on this project. Here's how the time was roughly divided:

- Setting up core navigation and coordinators: 1 hour  
- Building the recipe list and detail views: 1hour 
- State management and debugging: 2 hours  
- UI polish and iteration: 1 hour

## Trade-offs and Decisions

I chose not to implement data persistence (e.g., Core Data or local storage) in this version to keep the scope focused on architecture and navigation. Additionally, I avoided third-party libraries to keep the project lightweight and easier to review.

---

## Weakest Part of the Project

The app doesnâ€™t currently support offline access or persistent favorites. This is an area I'd focus on improving with more time, likely by integrating local storage or caching strategies.

## Additional Information

- The project uses SwiftUI and is structured using the Coordinator Pattern for clear separation of concerns.
- Built and tested with Xcode 15, targeting iOS 17.
- Future improvements could include offline support, favorites/bookmarks, and basic analytics or usage tracking.
